<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was created by 8Miles8 because I do a lot of theater work, and most of the time in rehearsals half the cast and most of the crew has no idea where in the show we are, so I created this project that uses speech recognition to match what's going on onstage to the scene, and broadcasts it to a satelite device

### Built With

* [Python](https://python.org/)

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

* Start up the server
* Start up the client
* Enter lines, with "act x scene x" (referred to as "scene markers") before the start of each scene (these markers should appear automatically. It is very important not to delete any. If your production does not use every scene marker, just leave the spaces empty. The program will error out if it cannot find every scene marker.)

### Dependencies & Prerequisites

Client: 

* Any version of Python 3 (Windows systems)

* Python 3.6 or lower for non-widows systems (updated compatibility coming, until then use a virtual environment or older Python version. PyAudio doesn't have non-Windows wheels for newer vesions.)

* speechrecognition
  ```sh
  pip install speechrecognition
  ```

* pyaudio
  ```sh
  pip install pipwin
  pipwin install pyaudio
  ```
  
* tkinter
  ```sh
  pip install tk
  ```
