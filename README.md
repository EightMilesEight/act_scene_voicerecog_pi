It uses speech recognition to recognize what scene is being performed/rehearsed on a stage, and have a remote
Raspberry Pi connected to a seven-segment display it in the format of "A<act>S<scene>"

Github user Uberi is an absolute legend for this one. Found this thread from years ago and this guy
helped so many people with various errors out of the kindness of his heart, and
the answers I found helped me solve a PyAudio/SpeechRecognition ALSA bug that stumped me for a week. 
If you're seeing this, Uberi, I just want to say thanks.

Some real-life people who tolerated and helped me in massive ways (you know who you are):
