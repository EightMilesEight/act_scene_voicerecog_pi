<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was created by 8Miles8 because I do a lot of theater work, and most of the time in rehearsals half the cast and most of the crew has no idea where in the show we are, so I created this project that uses speech recognition to match what's going on onstage to the scene, and broadcasts it to a satelite device
