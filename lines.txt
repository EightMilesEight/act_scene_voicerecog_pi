act 1 scene 1
welcome to the renaissance
war of the roses
that was so middle ages
barbaric
culture
act 2 scene 2
write like we speak
single word
last three plays
did I miss my cue
what are you wearing
this isn’t dress rehearsal
thought it might help me get into character
I have a question about motivation
you given up yet
This one is working, I can feel it
I did write something in my notebook last night
flirt
but now that I’ve said it out loud
why you let me write with you
let us talk of graves
make dust our paper
shut it down
next production
who goes backwards
he breaks convention
two lovers who kill themselves in the end
I’m seeing it this evening
life changing
ruining everything
I paid for an original
you will lose my
unless I hear a new idea
I think that means
write something original
the Bard because he does it all
not funny
do we still have a job
act 1 scene 3
I recently heard about a man
He doesn’t throw his
and then into the street
really just a poet at heart
why did I ever suggest he become a writer
why we work together
hit a little setback
name a character
Shakespeare already promised that
cut me in as an investor
money lender
temple to me
if I let you invest
finally have an audience
act 1 scene 4
I went to the stocks
cabbages
criminals
delicious
took our last shilling right out of my hand
sheep
been through this
been a while since
why I was thinking
that will just make me feel like a failure
I just thought of the perfect job
go out and earn some money
I just want to make things better
I need to know that you understand
Eat your cabbage
gonna get you boys some meat
goes out in the town square
think I can write
under this sort of pressure
act 1 scene 5
palm readings
I need more than luck
supposed to be the best
did I hear a need for future seeing
share the same gifts
esteemed uncle
keep looking
beware
black dog
asylum
will the next big thing in theater be
a play where the dialogue stops
the plot is conveyed through song
actor is saying his lines and then
And people actually like this
even told you the best part
bursting into spontaneous dance
act 1 scene 6
language
I guess a guy can only wait so long
do you know who her father is
scourge
men dress as women and kiss other men
gateway to lustful desires and fantasies
you really want that guy giving a speech
simple minds from the one true book
you know the big idea
I want you to listen with an open mind
How better to express the inner longings
dusted it off and started banging
was the Bible written from the heart
writing about an event
the most significant historical event
act 1 scene 7
Shakespeare would never
which leads to dancing
pulled down
I have much influence with
continue promoting this filth
let that happen
act 1 scene 8
we just lost our patron
I already made a penny
find us
backer
please tell me I can count on you
good days were those when lit
I accidentally took this after our first encounter
are really doing something to me
I was just a kid then
personal
recitation
Shakespeare in the park
act 1 scene 9
hands together for the one
a little sonnet that’s been very good to me
You up to this or not
I told you to cut this out
but they were looking for good strong men
the news when you got home
mood
country cottage more than ever
You go home and rest
going to be a father
already got a Puritan saying my
listen to critics
your brother is at a private party for William Shakespeare
guess who has an invitation
act 1 scene 10
parched
right here in this room
this feast for the eyes
What are you and that brother of yours working on
tragic
attempt at comedy
see what I did there
even when I was a lowly actor
with you as his partner
all the world’s a stage
trust me I have no desire to stay
we should actually thank this man
you dare to cross me and corrupt
I told you to stay away from her
Shakespeare nearly got your notebook
watch your back
our new show about
act 1 scene 11
musical should be
I need an idea that is guaranteed
cross that line
just come up with an idea of your own
maybe if I had more time or less pressure
you will pay a great price
got a baby on the way
talking about
generations
suddenly looking brighter
